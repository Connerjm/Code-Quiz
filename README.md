## Introduction

This is the fourth homework in the bootcamp. My task will be to create a simple web application that allows the user to take a timed multiple choice quiz with coding questions to receive a score. It will feature a responsive layout with a header housing the highscore button and timer. The main content will by the questions that will dynamically replace each other as questions are answered till the quiz is complete.
